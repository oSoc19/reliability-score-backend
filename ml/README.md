# Machine Learning

This folder contains all the data, scripts and the Jupyter notebook required to train the model, load it and use it to make predictions.

# data
The `data` folder contains all the preprocessed files generated by the scripts below

# scripts/holidays
The `holidays` script scrapes a list of holidays from https://kalender-365.be. These are then saved in `{year}.csv` and can be used for the machine learning model (not yet implemented).

# scripts/school-vacations
Similarly to the `holidays` script, this script scrapes a list of school vacations from https://onderwijs.vlaanderen.be/nl/schoolvakanties-vorige-schooljaren and saves it as `vacations.csv`.

# scripts/weather
This script scrapes weather data for the past few years from https://meteo.be and saves it as `weather-2016-2019.csv`.

# scripts/make-prediction
This script loads the model that was trained and exported by the Jupyter notebook and uses it to predict a delay, given a train ID and a timestamp.

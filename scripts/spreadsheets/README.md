:warning: *Most of these scripts require files that are generated by other scripts. Run in the order they are listed in in this file.*

## crawler.py
`crawler.py` downloads all the Excel files listed in `list_spreadsheets.csv` and stores them in the `downloads/` folder. *Requires `list_spreadsheets.csv` in the same directory.*

## convert.py
`convert.py` converts all the downloaded Excel files to more readable CSVs using the `xlsx2csv` library and stores them in `csv/`. *Requires Excel files in `download/` folder.*

## check_files.py
`check_files.py` loops through all the Excel files listed in `list_spreadsheets.csv` and checks if there's a converted CSV version in the `csv/` folder. If not, it prints the name of the missing file(s). *Requires `list_spreadsheets.csv` and `csv/` folder.*

## one_file.py
`one_file.py` reads all the CSV files generated by `convert.py` and merges them together into one large CSV file that can be used for statistics and machine learning. *Requires `csv/` folder*

## crawler.py
`crawler.py` downloads all the Excel files listed in `list_spreadsheets.csv` and stores them in the `downloads/` folder.

## convert.py
`convert.py` converts all the downloaded Excel files to more readable CSVs using the `xlsx2csv` library and stores them in `csv/`.

## check_files.py
`check_files.py` loops through all the Excel files listed in `list_spreadsheets.csv` and checks if there's a converted CSV version in the `csv/` folder. If not, it prints the name of the missing file(s).

## one_file.py
`one_file.py` reads all the CSV files generated by `convert.py` and merges them together into one large CSV file that can be used for statistics and machine learning.

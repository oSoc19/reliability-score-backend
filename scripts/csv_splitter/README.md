# csv_splitter

This script splits the big CSV generated by `spreadsheets/one_file.py` into a lot of smaller CSVs for every train id (like IC3308.csv) for the whole year. Then it collects the arrival and departure delays for every day and some statistics (the minimum and maximum values and the mean, median and variance) and puts all this in even smaller json files (the json file is smaller because it doesn't contain the station URI on every line).

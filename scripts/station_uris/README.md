# station_uris

## unique_stations.py
`unique_stations.py` takes the big CSV generated by `spreadsheets/one_file.py` as input and outputs a list of all the unique stations to `unique_stations.json`.

# station_to_uri.py
`station_to_uri.py` takes `unique_stations.json` and iRail's `stations.csv` as input and tries to match as many stations as possible. It then performs a fuzzy search for the stations it couldn't find and gives suggestions the user can select them manually.
